Any and all combinations of the above does not work.\\n\\nRequested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.\\n\\nGame won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.\\n\\n\\nUPDATE:\\n\\nFiled a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund. \\n\\nSo, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office.

       "  'review': \"Pathetic. Utterly pathetic. \\n\\nI'm so glad I only played with their EA-Play subscription system.\\n[b] WITH A REVENUE OF 7 BILLION US DOLLARS IN 2022 [/b] you are one of the biggest gaming companys on this earth and with your EA-Sports franchise you have the single biggest market regarding sports simulations, yet.. after so many years THIS is the pinnical of utter trash. Disregarding your horrendous gambling system in FUT, FIFA23 is the most unoptimized game for the PC platform in gaming history. Comparing CP2077 to this wouldn't even be fair, not only because it was a rushed title giving in to fans demanding to play after some brilliant PR, no, at least I was able to START THE GAME. \\n\\nI have played many early access games in the past 5-6 years and your FULLY RELEASED - NON ALPHA/BETA game is the worst. I wouldn't even dare to write a gameplay opinion about it, because in order to do so fairly I would've needed the chance to play at least ONE MATCH without stuttering, disconnects and lags.\\n\\nI usually don't write reviews, but this is INSANE. I highly recommend you NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE until they fix it.\",\n",

Hands down without a shadow of a doubt this is the worst game i have ever played, if you want to feel like you are being completely robbed out of any competitive experience throughout the whole game then this is the game for you. It seems to me this is another case of great idea yet with a terrible, unreliable and straight up horror of a company executing it. \\n\\nShort list of my major issues with this game.\\n- Majority of defending is automatic in this game so normal through balls are basically magnet practice for the defenders (My own players included doing unbelievable and quite frankly impossible tackles without me pressing a button)\\n- Passing is a joke and could go anywhere at any random moment.\\n- Someone can press one button and make the game unplayable with man marking and pressing tactics.\\n- Ballon d'or level players heavy touching the ball, not being able to even control a simple pass.\\n- Sometimes the ball resembles that of the black out ball from men in black.\\n- Tackle someone multiple times to watch the ball magnet back into one of the oppositions players \\n- Visibly being able to see my players get held back/ handicapped from going for the ball.\\n\\nI could honestly make these stupidly long, there is so many more game play issues.\\n\\nI'm not one for conspiracy theories but the DDA thing that everyone raves about seems quite visible in my eyes, some kind of momentum system built into the game or it could be the game play is that bad its turned a large portion of this community to even think it exists. On top of that they basically have a gambling system built into the game to scrape as much money as they possibly can even being visible to kids and vulnerable people.\\n\\nI hope they never get another FIFA contract, should be a criminal act to release a £60 game in this state. I have never wrote a review on a game in my life but this one has angered me too the point where if i can save one person from buying this game it would be worth it.\\n\\nEdit: People asking why i keep playing. I play the WL for coins and every time i do it makes me so angry to a point that no human being should ever feel like from playing a video game, the other time is just sat in the menus wishing the game was fun. Follow suit if you enjoy mental torture.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Currently as of September 28 the game is very poorly optimised on pc. The cut scenes lag like crazy and even the gameplay feels laggy no matter which setting I choose. I think I have a decent specs for fifa - i5 11th gen, RTX 3060 & 16 GB ram. The GPU utilisation in the menu is around 80-100% but in the actual gameplay only around 16-20 % lol. This game makes 0 sense. Plus the anti cheat is using around 30% cpu lol. I can run games like cyberpunk on 60 fps average high settings but seems like you need top of the line hardware & blessing from GOD to play this crap just so that anti cheat can use 30% of your cpu lol. For a sports game it's too demanding or unoptimised.\",\n",

The only way to have it working is installing Windows 10 on the deck, which is bad news cause the overall performance gets worsened on the deck with Windows. \\n\\nAnd why does it even have a kernel-level anti-cheat, if the FUT transfer market isn\\'t shared with us PC players?

But we PC players are excluded & can only trade between us. \\nA kernel-level anti-cheat has way higher privileges then it should & having it installed is like having a hole in your PC\\'s security that can be exploited by viruses.

It\\'s a step in the right direction compared with the last title, since at least now we got Hypermotion2 & crossplat for the first time in PC, but sadly there are aspects to improve (+ tons of bugs). \\n\\n[list]\\n[*]If you enable \"listen to music while on gameplay\" [spoiler](which allows you to listen to FIFA songs INSTEAD of the commentators)[/spoiler] you WON\\'T be able to skip songs while you\\'re playing a match & you\\'ll have to wait until the match is finished in order to skip the song. Also, no songs in online modes. For some reason is just plain silence for me. \\n[*] EA has DISABLED [url=https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay?snr=1_7_7_230#together]\"Remote Play Together\"[/url], so you won\\'t be able to invite your friends & play remotely, instead each one of you will have to pay $60. (Note that game publishers in Steam have the ability to enable or disable this).\\n[*]The mouse cursor hides itself at the center of the screen but in some instances it\\'s still functional, meaning that if you\\'re trying to select an option located on the edges, it won\\'t let you & you\\'ll think your controller is unresponsive, but is just the invisible mouse in the middle. So you\\'ll have to move it away in order to be able to select the other options. You can reproduce this issue going into FUT > Moments. \\n[*]If you have 2 controllers & want to play split-screen, both players should use the same button layout. None of you can use different control settings because if one is different, it will overwrite the other player controller settings.  [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/qjt7sk/xbox_series_x_fifa_22_second_controller_settings/]This happens to some users since FIFA 21 across all platforms,[/url] yet it has never been addressed by EA, which tells us they only care about FUT. \\n[*]After scoring a goal, the ball keeps rolling even if the player takes it with their hands as a celebration. \\n[*]The \"classic\" button scheme has been remapped, which doesn\\'t affect me but I\\'m just mentioning it for those who care: [b]LB+RB[/b] has been changed to \"power shot\". To execute a \"Low Driven shot\" you should gently press [b]B[/b] and release it asap. [b]LT+B[/b] does an outside foot shot if you\\'re running. \\n[*]Sometimes your controller & camera settings won\\'t get saved after closing & opening the game, it\\'s a pain having to set it up every single times.\\n[*]Australia women\\'s national team has been removed. \\n[/list]\\n\\nThere\\'s a 10-hour trial of this new FIFA 23 on [url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/pc-game-pass]Xbox PC GamePass ($1 the 1st month)[/url], & the whole game will be added to PC GamePass 7-9 months after its launch day (May-July 2023) like when they\\'ve added Fifa 22. So you should go try it. If 10hs aren\\'t enough, you can buy EA Play Pro ($15 a month) & you\\'ll get to play the whole game for 30 days, all the hours you want. Personally I would recommend waiting till the game hits $30, only then I\\'d buy it.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Honestly... The franchise is getting tired... I love the FIFA franchise and own every single title since FIFA 94. The animations are good with the mo-cap, and the additional teams etc are nice. \\n\\nHOWEVER.\\n\\nStill can't play this game without having to perform programmer level shenanigans. EA-Anticheat is so broken, that even uninstalling it and reinstalling does nothing. You can't have any overlays on which sucks major donkey bolas for those of us that play and use discord, or even our cards overlay like Nvidia's. \\n\\nIt's SUPER unoptimized. maximum and medium settings run the same for my rig which runs most modern AAA titles on ultra or very high. CGI cutscenes are choppy. gameplay is sometimes choppy depending on how it feels and it all adds up to an experience that would make you a pendehoe playing it in it's current state. \\n\\nI've tried getting a refund due to the dismal experience but they claim i can't because of the hours I have logged... Yes... Hours I have logged leaving the game open when I slept so I could still play without having to get a degree in computer engineering to get it to run.\\n\\nIf this still hasn't dissuaded you from purchasing this game, then wait until the game launch bugs are fixed or you're going to uninstall it out of frustration like I have. Typing this as i get ready to try for the 13th time, to see if they've fixed anything.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've always kinda defended FIFA. With the standard phrases like ''It's fun because it's a football game'', or ''You don't understand because you're not a football fan yourself''. But this is different. Way different.\\n\\nFIFA 23 doesn't even work... It's now a week after release and some folks still aren't able to even launch the game, I have to start Origin in Administrator Mode for it to work, but at least I can play. That being said, servers are trash. They always were, but it's even worse this time. Navigating through the menu's feels buggy and rough around the edges, the game is poorly optimized, and they even haven't fixed some issues that were in FIFA 22, which is astonishing to me.\\n\\nBut now for the most important part, the gameplay. This is where FIFA 23 has it's occasional shine. PC-Players finally got Next-Gen after being completely ignored with FIFA 22 last year. While playing the game, you can feel the game isn't as arcade-like anymore. It's much more slow-paced, and you have to actually think about your next move or pass on the pitch. On the other hand, the AI is mind-blowingly dumb... Players are standing still when the ball rolls past them 15 centimetres away from their feet. Or suddenly your attacker cancels his run past the last defender, which is incredibly frustrating. And maybe the most ridiculous and game-breaking one, if you play against the AI, for example in Career Mode or Squad Battles, the opponent's goalkeeper can't even receive a pass... Like seriously, they are scoring own-goals like it's nothing.\\n\\nSome new features like the Power Shots are fun and make for some absolute bangers, but the game overall is underwhelming. This combined with the fact that some people that paid 70 or 80 bucks (!!!) can't even start up the game, gave me the feeling I should write a review for this 5/10 game. For now, stay far away from it.\\n\\nCongratulations EA, you've made the last FIFA, the worst FIFA.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've bought every single FIFA since 2016 and this is by far the worst. The amount of problems it has on PC is insane. Here's a list of some I encountered:\\n\\n- Game doesn't start when I press play on Steam (I had to close Origin via Task Manager and try a few times)\\n\\n- Once that works, it says that anticheat is already installed and crashes the moment the game opens (fixed by manually uninstalling their anticheat and reinstalling it, but it doesn't always work)\\n\\n- Very high GPU usage and temperatures in the menus, much higher than when I'm actually in game. I have a good PC and no game has ever used this many resources. It runs at 144fps, but the temperatures and % usage is unacceptable.\\n\\n- Limiting the game to 60fps via the graphics menu does not work since it's a Vsync setting (full or half frames) based on your monitor refresh rate. This is something that hasn't been fixed for a few years now.\\n\\nBoth this and gpu usage were fixed by changing graphics to low and limiting fps to 60 via Nvidia control panel.\\n\\nKeep in mind that even if you manage to make the game work, it's not guaranteed to keep working in the future. The gameplay is also a considerable downgrade from last year, but some people like it so I suppose that's subjective. Overall, it's clear that they don't care about PC. The price is the same as console version though, so I expect the same quality. \\n\\nI'll change my review if things improve, but that is very unlikely.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'EA, you did it again. You messed up the launch, again. Like you do every year. It is totally unacceptable that you charge almost 100 bucks for the Ultimate Edition that grants you 3 days early access - let us be real, that is why most of us buy Ultimate Edition - but launching the game 3 days early is basically a game of Russian roulette - either you are lucky as hell and the game launches and plays, or you are unlucky like thousands of consumers and get error messages, failing anti-cheat and whatever else there is preventing people from getting what they paid for. This is a complete slap in the face to your customers and something you should address immediately. \\n\\nThe anti-cheat is a good idea and I am glad it is coming to PC, as the previous iterations of FIFA on PC were clearly plagued by hackers - so this is a welcomed addition, but the execution of the anti-cheat is horrendous. I know people that bought the Ultimate Edition that should have been able to play the game 2 days ago that still can not launch the game due to the anti-cheat being absolutely garbage. Fix this. \\n\\nBugs, where do I begin? There are a plethora of bugs in the game, from missing sponsors on a dozen of kits, visual bugs like the ball becoming super blurry and the performance of the actual game itself completely tanking. I am on a 3060 and an i5-11400CPU and there is no chance in hell my FIFA should be full of stutters and lags. The lag in the menu is atrocious, set-pieces and cinematics (I love the addition of cinematics) is PLAGUED by frame-drops which makes them horrible and painful to look at. Given how much of a copy-paste game FIFA is every year, these bugs are inexcusable. \\n\\nUsually, every year, we are used to getting the new stadiums of the teams that are promoted to say the Premier League. Where is Nottingham Forest\\' stadium? Last year you had to give us Leeds\\' stadium through an update later and you were excused due to COVID, but what is the excuse now? This is just laziness - you mean to tell me a billion dollar company like EA with well over a year of development can not make the stadium ready for release? Call this nitpicking, but for me it is the small things that matter.\\n\\nAs far as actual gameplay goes, I do enjoy the feeling of the players and the ball. It feels like the players and the ball have actual weight to it now and it feels much less arcade-like to me. I thoroughly enjoy the slower pace feel, although it could do with some fine tuning. The new engine makes a massive difference (thank God you brought it to PC this year) and it is noticeable, so in that regard I am hopeful for a good year of FIFA. \\n\\nWith all of these things addressed, I would like to say this year sees the end of an era. I started playing FIFA in 2003 on my brother\\'s original Xbox and I have played pretty much every iteration since. I grew up with the game and I have so many good memories like coming home from school and inviting friends over to play some FIFA. That is what the beautiful game is all about - the game that has seen us cry, laugh, angry and every other conceivable emotion possible. The game we know as \"FIFA\" will be no more, but that does not mean the end of football games - I am hopeful for the future and I HOPE that EA will start caring more and focus on improving their games and game-modes that have been heavily neglected (I am looking at you, Career Mode and Pro Clubs). \\n\\nArrivederci, FIFA, it has been an honour.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] The biggest fall from grace I have ever seen [/h1]\\n\\n[b] Technical Issues [/b]\\nIf you buy this game you might not be able to start it like the majority of people as you will see in other reviews. In order to start this game you will firstly need to enter your BIOS, on your high end PC, and change some settings, which if you don't know what you're doing can be extremely risky to the health of your PC. And from then on you will need to uninstall and re install EA's anti cheat on every start up of this game. Once in game you'll find that despite your ultra expensive custom high end PC, the menus are extremely laggy and unresponsive. If you want to tab out of this game, be sure that when you tab in, to move your mouse cursor to the very top right of your screen and out the way, because this game cannot disable the mouse while playing so if the mouse is hovering over a certain menu icon, and you try to navigate with your controller instead, the game will simply bug out. So just from a technical stand point this game is already atrocious.\\n\\n[b] Gameplay Issues [/b]\\nThe game should be advertised as arcade, not the hyper realistic game it markets to be with all these new motion captures, ball physics etc that mislead. The gameplay is arcade, plain and simple. Remember FIFA matches being 5/6 mins a half, [i] by default. [/i] Well this time the default is now 3 minutes a half, why? Because any longer, even on the highest difficulty, the score of the match will be 7-7 and you will be fighting against the game just to keep the score down to actually feel a sense of realism. Dribbling is so stupid I can't even put it into words, players are on ice here, no studs in the ground, every player has 1000 agility, because the way they chop and turn and dribble makes no sense, not even Messi can dribble like this in real life, and this is amplified against the AI on any high difficulty, you will not get the ball for at least 2.5 minutes of the 3 minute half because their dribbling is simply uncontrollable.\\n\\n[b] Career Mode [/b]\\nWe all know career mode has been on the decline in forever, which every new feature either breaking the game or being pointless, the dynamic sim feature where you watch dots play like its FM needs so much work, its so bare bones and you will always need to jump in to save your side losing. The new highlight mode is complete garbage with only having a select few highlights, so once you've seen and played a few, you've played them all, and the scenarios get extremely repetitive because of this. Transfers get a transfer rating and whoever rating your business literally has 0 business sense, and you'll likely get sacked for making good business, not to mention you can't loan players out because every loan offer is a loan to buy with a stupid price that can't be negotiated without the deal falling through. All in all another stinker for career mode.\\n\\n[b] Online [/b]\\nI never got round to playing online as I spent all of my short time in this game troubleshooting and trying to fix the offline game play with various slider settings. But I can imagine the arcade feel of this game translates well to an online simplified experience where you do ridiculous skill moves and score plenty of goals. FUT mode is absolutely packed with features and I would recommend this mode if you have plenty of money you want to spend on getting the best players and items.\\n\\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\\nI have played FIFA all my life, since FIFA 2004, growing up with the game, buying it every year and without fail playing hundreds of hours. FIFA 17 onwards my hours declined as did the game, but it was still playable up until this release. I can't understand how this game was even able to release in the technical state its in and I genuinely can't believe the huge decline this franchise has gone on over the past half a decade. I'm extremely disappointed. But this game really shows EA for what they are, with extreme amounts of income, can't even spend on the resources to make this game actually playable, its a complete ripoff of all its fans and the kids that spend serious amounts of money on FUT every year, and everyone who has bought this game year in year out faithfully to play career mode.\\n\\nUtter disaster, don't purchase this game.\\n\\n[h1] 0/10 [/h1]\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Now that the game is on sale and a lot of people would be looking to get it, here is my honest opinion about it. The game wont feel like it's worth the full amount as it is a Fifa 22 re-skin. However, it still is a solid pick up for the offer and you wont feel let down. After so long the game looks better on PC and the gameplay is solid too. Defending feels way less sloppy and keepers are more closer to their human counterparts. Attacking can be done cleverly and defenders no longer catch up to you as pace ratings play a more important role atleast from what i have experienced. That said, the game isnt completely bug free with occasional glitches popping up even in my short span of play but it isnt cyberpunk level broken. I obviously do not support the way EA milks the FIFA series but this game definitely deserves a slightly better rating. As for anyone experiencing frame drops, turning off dynamic resolution helped fix that issue for me.\",\n",
